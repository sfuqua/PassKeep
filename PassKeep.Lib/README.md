The "Lib" project contains most of the logic of PassKeep. Lib is where all of the folowing code lives:

 * KeePass interop (DOM structure, encryption and decryption)
 * Password generation
 * File IO
 * Interacting with settings
 * ViewModels - the logic that ties the app together

Basically everything that makes the app run except for the UI itself.
